Rune is a humble companion for creators — a tool shaped by craftsmanship and intent.  
It helps you turn structureless ideas into meaningful scaffolds: files, folders, and foundations that breathe consistency into your projects.

Rather than dictating how you build, Rune listens — adapting through templates, generators, and plugins to fit your own rhythm of creation.

A whisper of automation, a touch of artistry — that’s the Rune way.

> [!NOTE]
> Rune is currently in active development and will be available soon.  
> Stay tuned — the ritual is being refined.

Every star helps keep the forge burning and the ritual alive.

## 🧩 Background

Rune began as a small experiment — a search for a generator that felt **personal, flexible, and expressive**. Inspired by the simplicity of [**plop**][url-to-plop] and the delightful developer experience of [**clack**][url-to-clack], it was forged to bring a sense of _craftsmanship_ back into automation.

Rune isn’t here to dictate your workflow — it’s here to **adapt** to it. A tool that doesn’t just generate files, but helps you weave patterns of creation unique to your project.
